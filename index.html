    <h1>discussion of Western/ Eurocentric design.</h1>
    <h2>White supremacy in Design</h2>
    <h3>Analogies and examples from this article are helpful in contextualizing this conversation. </h3>
    <h4>The discussion of how Helvetica was intended to be <span class="highlight">completely neutral</span></h4>
    <h5>I agree that given that Helvetica was created with the Western, white idea of universality inherently makes it non-neutral.  </h5>
    <h6>I also found the example of the font <span class="highlight2">“chop suey”</span> on take out boxes most helpful in understanding how appropriated design can
      be when white western influence attempts to include “others.” Finally I found the discussion of the <span class="highlight">paradox of “white culture”</span>
      individualistic yet invisible- and how it relates to the modernism movement very interesting, as it was a point I’d never considered
      but holds a lot of truth.</h6>
